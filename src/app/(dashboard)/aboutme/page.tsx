      <p>
        Hello! I am a beginner level software developer looking to start my
        career.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have previously completed a list of projects that you can browse on my
        github profile or you can navigate to my projects page and view the
        projects that I have completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside this portfolio you will be able to find a list of the technology
        that I have used in past projects, as well as tech that I am interested
        in learning to help further developer my coding journey.
      </p>
      <h2>Why am I a fit for your company?</h2>
      <p>
        As a junior developer I am eager to learn and grow my coding knowledge.
        I work towards bettering my code with each project that I undertake.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience working on projects by myself, in a team of two and in
        a five person team. Each project held their different challenges, which
        I am always eager to overcome.
      </p>
      <h2>My personal life</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of coding I spend most of my team either with my family, playing
        video games or watching netflix.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had my first child in 2024 and watching her grow and develop has
        become a joy of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am not with my family I can usually been found on my computer
        playing a game or coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        My all time favourite game which I go back to every few years is Rares
        masterpiece, Banjo-Kazooie.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy most genres of games, including: Realtime strategy, MMO and
        RPGs.
