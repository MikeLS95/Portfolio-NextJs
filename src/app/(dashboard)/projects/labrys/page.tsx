      <h1>Projects I completed at Labrys</h1>
      <p>
        After Coder Academy I was provided with a placement where I worked at
        Labrys as an intern twice a week for ten weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        While at Labrys I completed a project management app with four other
        coder Academy interns; Ben, Sam, Jacob and Kasun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Labrys is a web3 and blockchain development company who engage with
        their clients to build full service websites and applications.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h2>Pump.Task</h2>
        <p>
          The five of us interns collaborated on our first project outside of
          Coder Academy together. Each bringing individual skills and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I helped construct multiple parts of the application, including
          interacting with the smart contract, creating and minting NFTs.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main contribution to the project was my work on the profile pages,
          where users can view their profile overview and their NFT badges that
          they have received from using our app.
        </p>

        <h2>Tech Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          After we finished our first project, we were given a tech assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tech assessment was to be completed in four hours without prior
          knowledge of what was being asked of us.
